# Hysi "Have You Seen It?"

This repository was used for a project for subject "Software para Sistemas Empotrados y Dispositivos Móviles" (Software for Embedded and Mobile Devices) during my Software Engineering studies at University of Málaga.

The project consists of an Android application where an user can get help finding items they may have lost. Users create announcements of items they have lost, and other users can see those announcements and contact with their author to help them find the item.
